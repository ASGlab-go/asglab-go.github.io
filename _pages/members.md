I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Smart Energy Systems (Education & Research) within the [Department of Engineering at the University of Exeter](https://engineering.exeter.ac.uk/). I am running the "AI for Smart Grid" ([ASG](/asg-lab)) lab, which currently includes a team of over 7 researchers. I also serve as a Research Fellow in Market Design for Low Carbon Energy Systems at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/research/control-and-power/), working within [Professor Goran Strbac](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/g.strbac)'s group, where I lead research on electricity market design. At the University of Exeter, I am the module leader for [*Introduction to Power Systems and Plant*](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/study/studyinformation/modules/info/?moduleCode=ENGM045&ay=2025&sys=1) and [*Resilience of Electrical Energy Systems*](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/study/studyinformation/modules/info/?moduleCode=ENGM032&ay=2025&sys=1), both part of the MSc programme in [*Electrical Power and Smart Grids*](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/courses/engineering/epsg/). I also lecture the [*Electric Machines and Power Electronics*](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/study/studyinformation/modules/info/?moduleCode=ENGM009&ay=2025&sys=1) module. I also contribute as a guest lecturer at Imperial College London for the courses *Power System Economics*, *Selected Topics in Power Systems*, and *Smart Grid and Data Science* in the MSc programme in [*Future Power Networks*](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate-taught/future-power-networks/).

I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Northumbria University in 2014, followed by an M.Sc. degree in Power System Engineering from University College London in 2015. I completed my Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering at Imperial College London in 2020. After earning my doctorate, I joined Imperial College London as a Research Associate. Since June 2023, I has been promoted to be a Research Fellow in Market Design for Low-Carbon Energy Systems at Imperial College London.
